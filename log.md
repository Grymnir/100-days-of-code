# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Decmber 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made two simple C# Console Applications. One in Fibonacci and one FizzBuzz. Then i did the cource on freecodecamp on basic HTML and HTML5.

**Thoughts**: I did 100 days of code challenge before, but i got busy with an education that i got into. Then I became a full stack developer in C# and .NET CORE. But now i am back and it feels good! Programming is the future for me and I am planning to do everything from simple webapplications and up to games based on the Unity SDK!
